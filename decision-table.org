* General algorithm

- =Item=: type of the item being updated.
- =sellIn'=: current sell-in (after having being decremented for the update).
- =quality'=: updated quality.

Post-conditions are enforced by the "clamping" table. This is where we'll ensure the quality of non-Sulfuras items is always in [0, 50], for example.

| Item     | sellIn' | quality'    |
|----------+---------+-------------|
| Sulfuras | -       | quality     |
| Brie     | >= 0    | quality + 1 |
| Brie     | < 0     | quality + 2 |
| Pass     | > 10    | quality + 1 |
| Pass     | [6, 10] | quality + 2 |
| Pass     | [1, 5]  | quality + 3 |
| Pass     | < 0     | 0           |
| Regular  | >= 0    | quality - 1 |
| Regular  | < 0     | quality - 2 |
| Conjured | >= 0    | quality - 2 |
| Conjured | < 0     | quality - 4 |

* Clamp

- =Sulfuras=: is the item Sulfuras?
- =quality'=: updated quality.
- =quality''=: quality, adjusted to fit requirements.

| Sulfuras | quality' | quality'' |
|----------+----------+-----------|
| T        | -        |        80 |
| F        | > 50     |        50 |
| F        | < 0      |         0 |
| F        | [0, 50]  |   quality |
